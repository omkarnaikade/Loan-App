**#LoanEase** – Personal Loan Application System (Business Analyst Portfolio Project)

**LoanEase** is a FinTech domain business analysis project that showcases the complete SDLC lifecycle for a digital personal loan platform.

This project simulates real-world business analyst responsibilities, covering everything from requirement gathering to test case design, user workflows, and system integrations. It demonstrates how borrowers can register, complete KYC, explore loan products, apply for a loan, and manage EMIs — while admin users oversee loan processing and system security.
